# Basic OOP Concepts
Learn the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming through four progressively challenging exercises.

## Overview
This module contains 4 challenges designed to teach core Object-Oriented Programming concepts:
1. Class Basics - "Pet Shop"
2. Class Inheritance - "Vehicle Factory" 
3. Encapsulation - "Bank Account"
4. Polymorphism - "Shape Calculator"

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing these challenges, you will be able to:
- Create and work with classes in JavaScript
- Implement inheritance between classes
- Apply encapsulation principles to protect data
- Utilize polymorphism for flexible code design
- Write clean, maintainable object-oriented code

## Pre-requisites
Before starting these challenges, you should have:
- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- Understanding of functions and objects
- Familiarity with ES6+ syntax
- A code editor of your choice
- A browser or Node.js for running JavaScript

## Challenge Structure
Each challenge follows this format:

### 1. Objectives
Clear statements of what you'll learn from the challenge

### 2. Restrictions
- Rules about what JavaScript features you can/cannot use
- Specific implementation requirements
- Naming conventions that must be followed

### 3. Hints
- Important concepts to remember
- Function/method names that must be used
- Tips for implementation

### 4. Directions
- Detailed explanation of the problem
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Example inputs and outputs
- Test cases to verify your solution

## Challenges Overview

### 1. Pet Shop
Create a pet management system with classes for different types of pets.
- Focus: Basic class creation and methods
- Key Concepts: constructors, instance methods, this keyword
- Difficulty: ⭐️

### 2. Vehicle Factory
Build a vehicle classification system using inheritance.
- Focus: Class inheritance and method overriding
- Key Concepts: extends, super, parent/child relationships
- Difficulty: ⭐️⭐️

### 3. Bank Account
Implement a secure banking system using encapsulation.
- Focus: Data protection and validation
- Key Concepts: private fields, getters/setters
- Difficulty: ⭐️⭐️

### 4. Shape Calculator
Design a shape calculation system using polymorphism.
- Focus: Flexible object behavior
- Key Concepts: method overriding, type handling
- Difficulty: ⭐️⭐️⭐️

## Testing Your Solutions
Each challenge includes manual test cases that you can run in your browser console or Node.js environment. Example:

```javascript
// Example test case format
console.log("Test Case 1:");
const myObject = new MyClass(param1, param2);
console.log(myObject.someMethod()); // Expected output: xyz

console.log("Test Case 2:");
// Additional test cases...
```

## Success Criteria
To complete each challenge successfully:
1. Your code must pass all provided test cases
2. You must follow OOP principles outlined in the challenge
3. Your implementation must meet all restrictions
4. Code should be clean and well-commented

## Resources
- MDN Web Docs on Classes and OOP
- JavaScript.info OOP tutorials
- W3Schools JavaScript Classes reference

## Tips for Success
1. Read the entire challenge before starting
2. Write out your solution plan
3. Test frequently as you code
4. Consider edge cases
5. Review and refactor your code

## Next Steps
After mastering these basic concepts, you'll be ready to move on to:
- Intermediate OOP Properties
- Design Patterns
- Advanced JavaScript Concepts
